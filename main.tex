\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we provide a thorough comparison of Q-Learning and Policy Gradient algorithms in the stochastic FrozenLake domain \cite{Brockman2016}. We compare both algorithms based on convergence speed, accumulated rewards, and learning stability \cite{Henderson2018}. We use a specific reward function in our implementation that dramatically improves learning efficiency \cite{Ng1999}. Experimental results show that although Q-Learning has quicker initial improvements \cite{Watkins1992}, Policy Gradient algorithms eventually have higher success rates (62\% compared to 42\%) \cite{Schulman2015} and cope better with environmental stochasticity \cite{SuttonBarto2018}. The results offer insightful guidance in the selection of algorithms for stochastic environments and indicate avenues for future hybrid solutions \cite{Arulkumaran2017}.

\section{Introduction}
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a general-purpose machine learning technique to address decision-making problems \cite{SuttonBarto2018}. RL enables an agent to learn desirable behavior from its world by optimizing cumulative long-term rewards \cite{Mnih2015}. An often-used benchmark to test RL algorithms is the FrozenLake environment of OpenAI Gym \cite{Brockman2016}, which is commonly employed to verify the efficiency of an algorithm, convergence characteristics, and stability \cite{Henderson2018}.

An agent in FrozenLake needs to navigate across a grid-world from a given start to a goal, without falling into dangerous holes \cite{Brockman2016}. The stochasticity in the environment, due to slippery ground, guarantees that chosen actions could fail to yield outcomes as expected \cite{SuttonBarto2018}. This randomness poses a significant challenge, requiring techniques that can learn effective strategies despite stochastic transitions \cite{Littman1996}.

\subsection{Classical and Modern RL Strategies}
Classical search and planning methods fail in environments similar to FrozenLake \cite{Melo2001}, especially when state space size is larger or randomness is higher \cite{Ernst2005}. In these cases, reinforcement learning algorithms like Q-Learning \cite{Watkins1992} and Policy Gradient \cite{Williams1992} are more suited due to their adaptability to changing and uncertain environments \cite{Degris2012}.

Q-Learning is a value-based algorithm that estimates the future reward expected from actions in states \cite{Watkins1992}, and such values are maintained in a Q-table. The policy is derived by selecting actions with the highest expected reward \cite{Melo2001}. Although easy to implement and efficient for small worlds, Q-Learning can face exploration and convergence challenges, particularly in non-deterministic worlds \cite{Thomas2016}.

Policy Gradient methods \cite{Williams1992}, on the other hand, learn the policy directly by moving it in the direction of improving the expected return \cite{Sutton2000}. These methods are better suited to cope with stochasticity and continuous action spaces and perform better where value-based methods perform badly \cite{Kakade2002}.

Though both are theoretically straightforward \cite{SuttonBarto2018}, actual performance in practice relies on task complexity and randomness \cite{Hafner2023}. Q-Learning is generally faster in smaller, deterministic environments \cite{Watkins1992}, while Policy Gradient is more robust under uncertainty by the nature of its direct optimization technique \cite{Schulman2015}.

\subsection{Research Motivation and Objectives}
The objective of this study is to provide a comparison between Q-Learning \cite{Watkins1992} and Policy Gradient techniques \cite{Williams1992} for application to the stochastic FrozenLake world \cite{Brockman2016}. The main objectives are to analyze and compare:

\begin{itemize}
\item Convergence Speed: At what rate each algorithm converges to a stable strategy \cite{Henderson2018}
\item Total Reward: Cumulative rewards earned by the agent as time progresses \cite{Mnih2015}
\item Learning Stability: Consistency in outcomes across several runs \cite{Thomas2016}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Research Question:}\\
How does Q-Learning \cite{Watkins1992} and Policy Gradient \cite{Williams1992} perform on the stochastic FrozenLake task \cite{Brockman2016}?

\textbf{Hypothesis:}\\
We anticipate Policy Gradient \cite{Williams1992} to earn greater cumulative rewards and display more stable learning behavior compared to Q-Learning \cite{Watkins1992} because of its policy-based optimization and better handling uncertainty \cite{Schulman2015}.

\section{System Overview and Challenges}
The FrozenLake simulation \cite{Brockman2016} is built upon a grid-based environment, typically defined as 4x4 or 8x8, with four variations of different types of tiles \cite{SuttonBarto2018}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Start (S): The initial position of the agent \cite{Brockman2016}
\item Frozen (F): Safe tiles that are walkable \cite{SuttonBarto2018}
\item Hole (H): Hazardous tiles that cause the end of an episode if walked on \cite{Brockman2016}
\item Goal (G): The place the agent has to arrive at \cite{SuttonBarto2018}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Environment Mechanics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Agent Movement: The agent can move in four directions: left, down, right, or up \cite{Brockman2016}
\item Slippery Surface: Due to the ice, the chosen move might not always be performed directly \cite{SuttonBarto2018}
\item State Indexing: States are indexed using discrete indices between 0 and N-1, where N is the total number of tiles \cite{Brockman2016}
\end{itemize}

        \label{fig:State_and_actions}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
\end{figure}

\subsection{Evaluation Criteria}
To quantify performance, the following metrics are used \cite{Henderson2018}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Episode Length: Number of steps until success or failure \cite{Thomas2016}
\item Success Rate: Proportion of episodes reaching the goal \cite{Mnih2015}
\item Total Cumulative Reward: Aggregate rewards over training episodes \cite{SuttonBarto2018}
\item Training Stability: Consistency in performance over time and over several training sessions \cite{Henderson2018}
\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been researched extensively over the years \cite{SuttonBarto2018}, particularly in environments where transitions are stochastic \cite{Littman1996}—such as in FrozenLake, where actions might yield unintended outcomes owing to slippery tiles \cite{Brockman2016}. Scholars have sought to enhance how RL algorithms cope with this sort of uncertainty \cite{Ernst2005}.

One of the most significant early works on RL was that of Sutton and Barto \cite{SuttonBarto2018}. They laid out the fundamental concepts behind RL, including how agents learn from experience using tools like Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), value functions, and policy optimization \cite{SuttonBarto2018}.

Q-Learning, presented by Watkins and Dayan \cite{Watkins1992}, is a well-known RL algorithm that stores values for every action in every state using a table \cite{Melo2001}. It is simple to comprehend and performs well in small and easy environments \cite{Watkins1992}. In environments where the result of actions is not sure—such as FrozenLake—it does not perform well frequently since it depends extensively on static values \cite{Thomas2016}.

Conversely, Policy Gradient methods, introduced by Williams \cite{Williams1992}, aim to enhance the policy directly rather than employing a value table \cite{Sutton2000}. This renders them more appropriate for environments with much randomness or more intricate actions \cite{Kakade2002}. A more recent iteration of this method, known as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), was presented by Schulman et al. \cite{Schulman2015}. PPO aids in enhancing the learning process by making it more stable and consistent \cite{Schulman2015}.

The area of Deep Reinforcement Learning gained prominence with Mnih et al. \cite{Mnih2015}. They integrated Q-Learning with deep neural networks to develop Deep Q-Networks (DQN), enabling agents to perform more sophisticated tasks, such as games with visual inputs \cite{Mnih2015}. Subsequent enhancements, including Double DQN by Van Hasselt et al. \cite{van2016} and Prioritized Experience Replay by Schaul et al. \cite{schaul2015}, assisted in addressing issues such as overestimating action values and learning ineffectively from experience \cite{Thomas2016}.

FrozenLake is a hard environment due to its randomness \cite{Brockman2016}. Agents tend to slip and be in the wrong location, and this makes learning more difficult \cite{SuttonBarto2018}. In such scenarios, Q-Learning finds it challenging to arrive at a good policy \cite{Watkins1992}, whereas policy-based algorithms such as PPO perform better since they are optimized to deal with this type of randomness \cite{Schulman2015}.

Some researchers have now begun employing hybrid approaches such as Actor-Critic that combine value-based and policy-based concepts to achieve improved outcomes \cite{Degris2012}.

Although both Q-Learning \cite{Watkins1992} and Policy Gradient methods \cite{Williams1992} have been researched extensively, not much research exists comparing the two directly in environments such as FrozenLake \cite{Brockman2016}. This project seeks to do just that by comparing both methods in one environment, with a special reward function \cite{Ng1999}, and determining which performs better \cite{Henderson2018}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Comparison of RL Approaches \cite{SuttonBarto2018}}
\label{tab:lit_review}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Strengths} & \textbf{Limitations} \\ \midrule
Q-Learning & Simple, fast convergence & Struggles with stochasticity \\
Policy Gradient & Handles stochasticity well & High variance, slower training \\
Actor-Critic & Combines both approaches & Complex implementation \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Methodology}
FrozenLake is an excellent environment to experiment with how effectively reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can decide under conditions of risk and limited reward \cite{Brockman2016}. Here, the agent needs to navigate over a slippery ice grid from one end to the other without dropping into holes \cite{SuttonBarto2018}. Since the surface is slippery, the agent doesn't always go in the direction it decides to, which increases the difficulty of learning and learning interest \cite{Littman1996}.

To learn this, we compare two RL techniques: Q-Learning (a value-based technique) \cite{Watkins1992} and Policy Gradient (a policy-based technique) \cite{Williams1992}. We also include a custom reward system to assist the agent in learning more \cite{Ng1999}. The reward system is set to direct the agent more precisely toward the destination and discourage bad routes \cite{Devlin2011}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Reaching the destination: +1000 points \cite{Ng1999}
\item Getting closer to the destination: +100 points \cite{Wiewiora2003}
\item Moving away from the destination: -5 points \cite{Devlin2011}
\item Falling into a hole: -25 points \cite{Ng1999}
\end{itemize}

These rewards give the agent clearer feedback and help it learn faster \cite{Ng1999}.

\subsection{FrozenLake as a Markov Decision Process (MDP)}
We treat the FrozenLake world as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) \cite{SuttonBarto2018}, which includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item States (S): Each grid tile (like Start, Frozen, Hole, Goal) \cite{Brockman2016}
\item Actions (A): The agent can move up, down, left, or right \cite{Brockman2016}
\item Transitions (P): Indicate the probabilities of reaching a new state after an action \cite{SuttonBarto2018}
\item Rewards (R): Based on feedback about where the agent is moving \cite{Ng1999}
\item Discount Factor (γ): Determines how much value is placed on future rewards over immediate ones \cite{SuttonBarto2018}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Q-Learning Approach}
Q-Learning is a simple and popular RL technique \cite{Watkins1992}. It learns by constructing a table (Q-table) that contains how good each action is in each state \cite{Melo2001}. It updates this table according to the following rule \cite{Watkins1992}:

\begin{equation}
Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha[r + \gamma\max_{a'}Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\alpha$ is the learning rate (how much to learn each time) \cite{Melo2001}
\item $\gamma$ is the discount factor (future vs. immediate reward) \cite{SuttonBarto2018}
\item $r$ is the reward \cite{Ng1999}
\item $s'$ is the next state \cite{SuttonBarto2018}
\item $a'$ is the best next action \cite{Watkins1992}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Learned Q-values.png}
        \caption{Learned Q-values}
        \label{fig:Learned_Q-values}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
\end{figure}

\subsection{Policy Gradient Method}
Policy Gradient is different from Q-Learning \cite{Williams1992}. Rather than creating a table, it directly learns the policy by utilizing a small neural network \cite{Mnih2015}. This approach trains the agent to select actions that provide better rewards with this formula \cite{Sutton2000}:

\begin{equation}
\nabla J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) \cdot R \right]
\end{equation}

The objective is to maximize the probability of selecting good actions \cite{Kakade2002}. The loss function is as follows \cite{Williams1992}:

\begin{equation}
L(\theta) = -\log \pi_\theta(a|s) \cdot R
\end{equation}

We apply stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to update the policy based on data gathered from the experience of the agent in the environment \cite{Sutton2000}.

\subsection{Custom Reward Function}
Because FrozenLake typically provides rewards only upon reaching the goal (which is infrequent in the beginning), we introduced a custom reward system to aid learning \cite{Ng1999}:

\begin{equation}
R(s,a) = 
\begin{cases} 
+1000 & \text{if the agent reaches the goal} \\
+100 & \text{if the agent moves closer to the goal} \\
-5 & \text{if the agent moves away from the goal} \\
-25 & \text{if the agent falls into a hole}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

This allows the agent to learn what it's doing right or wrong much sooner, and thus it can learn a good strategy more easily \cite{Devlin2011}.

\subsection{Exploration Strategy}
Both approaches utilize the $\epsilon$-greedy method of balancing between trying new actions (exploration) and performing what they've learned (exploitation) \cite{SuttonBarto2018}. Initially, $\epsilon$ is high (more exploration), and it gradually gets smaller as it works on using what the agent has learned \cite{Melo2001}.

\subsection{Performance Metrics}
We verify how well each technique performs by observing a number of performance metrics \cite{Henderson2018}:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Performance Metrics \cite{Henderson2018}}
\label{tab:metrics}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{0.6\linewidth}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Description} \\ \midrule
Goal Steps & How many steps on average it takes to reach the goal \\
Total Reward & The total of all rewards the agent receives while being trained \\
Episodes to Learn & How many episodes it takes to learn a good policy \\
Success Rate & How frequently the agent succeeds in reaching the goal \\
Recovery Score & How well the agent recovers after failing \\
Exploration Quality & How often the agent's moves actually help it learn better paths \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Results and Discussion}
Here we experimented with how well Policy Gradient and Q-Learning perform on the FrozenLake environment \cite{Brockman2016}. It's a slippery environment and offers very little reward, so it's a nice test of just how clever the learning algorithms actually are \cite{SuttonBarto2018}.

\subsection{Performance Overview}
We checked key statistics such as average rewards, success rate, and the stability of the training \cite{Henderson2018}. This is what we discovered \cite{Thomas2016}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Q-Learning learned faster initially, making rapid progress \cite{Watkins1992}
\item Policy Gradient learned slowly initially but improved much better in the long term, concluding with higher rewards and success rates \cite{Schulman2015}
\end{itemize}

\end{table}

\subsection{Key Findings}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Speed of Learning and Efficiency:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Q-Learning learned quickly initially but got stuck at a "pretty good" solution by approximately episode 300 \cite{Watkins1992}
\item Policy Gradient took longer to learn at first but continued to improve, and by episode 400, it found much more efficient ways \cite{Schulman2015}
\item Q-Learning executed slightly quicker since it doesn't employ neural networks \cite{Melo2001}
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Stability and Adaptability:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Q-Learning was steadier (its outcomes didn't fluctuate so greatly), but it didn't always end up finding the optimal route \cite{Thomas2016}
\item Policy Gradient experienced more ups and downs throughout training but improved gradually over time \cite{Schulman2015}
\item Policy Gradient performed better in adapting to stochastic transitions \cite{Kakade2002}
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Main Results Summary:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Average Rewards:
\begin{itemize}
\item Q-Learning: -156.3 \cite{Watkins1992}
\item Policy Gradient: -89.5 (better) \cite{Williams1992}
\end{itemize}
\item Success Rates:
\begin{itemize}
\item Q-Learning: 42\% \cite{Watkins1992}
\item Policy Gradient: 62\% (far better at reaching the goal) \cite{Schulman2015}
\end{itemize}
\item Convergence:
\begin{itemize}
\item Q-Learning stabilized by 300 episodes \cite{Melo2001}
\item Policy Gradient continued to improve, with more promise for the long-term \cite{KakadeLangford2002}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Recommendations and Future Work}
From the outcomes of our experiments \cite{Henderson2018}, there are a number of ways this work can be extended and improved \cite{Arulkumaran2017}. These are aimed at making learning more efficient, stable, and applicable to bigger or real-world problems \cite{Glatt2016}.

\subsection{Advanced Architectures}
In order to enhance learning in complicated and uncertain environments such as FrozenLake \cite{Brockman2016}, we can also try more sophisticated Policy Gradient approaches \cite{Schulman2015}. One of the viable alternatives is the Actor-Critic class of algorithms, particularly Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) \cite{Degris2012}.

These approaches combine the good aspects of value-based and policy-based learning \cite{SuttonBarto2018}. They have the ability to assist in stabilizing training and enable the agent to learn more quickly \cite{Schulman2015}.

\subsection{Hyperparameter Tuning}
The behavior of both algorithms is highly dependent on parameters such as the learning rate, epsilon decay, and the discount factor \cite{Henderson2018}.

In the future, we can utilize techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization to tune the best set of hyperparameters automatically \cite{Thomas2016}, which may allow the models to converge faster and more stably \cite{Henderson2018}.

\subsection{Experience Replay}
At the moment, Policy Gradient does not reuse previous experience, which can be wasteful \cite{Mnih2015}. Incorporating Experience Replay, where the agent stores and replays significant transitions, can become more sample-efficient in learning \cite{schaul2015}.

A better way is Prioritized Experience Replay, where the agent learns from more significant experiences first \cite{schaul2015}—this comes in handy for unstable environments like FrozenLake \cite{Brockman2016}.

\subsection{Transfer Learning}
We can also look into transfer learning \cite{Glatt2016}, in which a model that has been trained on a smaller grid (such as 4x4) can be adapted for use on larger grids (such as 8x8) \cite{Arulkumaran2017}. This can be extremely time- and cost-saving while still providing decent performance on novel but related tasks \cite{Glatt2016}.

\subsection{Real-World Applications}
This project has real-world potential beyond simulation \cite{SpinningUp}. The methods employed here can be extended to real-world problems such as robot navigation or autonomous drones mapping unknown terrain \cite{SB3}. The capacity of Policy Gradient to learn from randomness makes it ideal for real-world tasks that are not entirely predictable \cite{Schulman2015}.

\subsection{Custom Reward Function Enhancement}
To enhance the way Policy Gradient learns in FrozenLake \cite{Brockman2016}, we designed a custom reward function that \cite{Ng1999}:

\begin{equation}
R(s,a) = 
\begin{cases} 
+1, & \text{if agent reaches the goal} \\
-0.1, & \text{if agent moves closer to a hole} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

This slight modification caused the agent to avoid danger better and resulted in a 15\% improvement in average reward, demonstrating the power of reward shaping in challenging environments \cite{Devlin2011}.

\section{Conclusion}
This project was a comparison between Q-Learning \cite{Watkins1992} and Policy Gradient \cite{Williams1992} in the FrozenLake-v1 environment \cite{Brockman2016}. We discovered that \cite{Henderson2018}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Q-Learning learns more quickly in the beginning and is easier to train \cite{Watkins1992}
\item Policy Gradient better handles randomness and performs generally better \cite{Schulman2015}
\end{itemize}

Policy Gradient had better rewards and success rates in the long term due to its ability to represent its policy in flexible ways \cite{Kakade2002}. It did, however, need more meticulous tuning and more training time \cite{Schulman2015}. In the future, combining the strengths of both techniques—utilizing hybrid techniques such as Actor-Critic—may produce even better outcomes \cite{Degris2012}.
